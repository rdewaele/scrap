What follows is a list of the subprojects in this repository, and a copy of
their README information.

arraywalk
---------
The arraywalk program creates an array and - you guessed it - walks through it.
This happens in a pre-encoded random fashion. Pre-encoded so individual
testcases can be run multiple times for a given array, which eliminates
variables when calculating average runtimes.
These tests are run for increasing array sizes, and several pre-encoded
patterns for each array size.
Overall, this should give a rather good impression about the influence of
caches in latency-optimized hardware (e.g. like a CPU, unlike a GPU).

configfiles
-----------
'bashrc' - My (currently extremely simple) Arch Linux bashrc.
'Xdefaults' - Mainly a collection of terminal color schemes.

euclidian_gcd
-------------
This is a straightforward way to implement Euclid's greated common divisor
algorithm. This specific implementation only uses one mathematical operation:
subtraction.

treecrawler
-----------
Here lives a collection of vector images depicting ways of visiting the
elements of tree-like data structures.

vimrc
-----
My personal, hand-baked vimrc. Most notable features are a color scherme that
I really like (3d party), and a latex plugin (3d party). Other changes include
mouse support, line numbering, custom status line, smart search, tabwidth of 2,
etcetera by default.
